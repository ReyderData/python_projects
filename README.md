* excel_to_csv.py is a semi-automatic converter from .xlsx to .csv

You run the .py and the only thing you ned to do is select the root folder which 
contains all the excel files you want to convert to csv and It will iterate through all subfolders
in it and create the csv files, if one already exists, it wil be skipped

At the moment, the separator and encoding are a comma and latin as default, can update to pass them as 
arguments to the function.
